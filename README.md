# Correlation Between Education Level and Income


This project investigates the relationship between education levels and income using data from the Kaggle 'Income Data' dataset. A Bayesian regression model is employed to predict income based on age, while a jitter plot visualizes the income distribution across different education levels. The findings suggest that higher education may not significantly impact income, particularly for individuals with education levels from 10th grade onward.
